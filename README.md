<p>This library uses the cookbook.io api to parse any online recipe into a json file and return a list of all necessary ingredients to make your dish!</p>

<h3>How to use:</h3>

<p>Simply copy the URL of your recipe and paste it into the input form on the site, then click the submit button to magically obtain a neat list of the ingredient you need to gather/buy.</p>
